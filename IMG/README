This is the STANDALONE sparcstation version of IMG and some misc audio
editing tools, written by Peter langston, edited and packaged by
Stephen Uhler.  This package represents only one part of a larger
collection of work, that may be released at a later date.   This
software was written about 1986; the current packaging was done in
1989.

The Programs fall into 4 categories:

1) Stuff needed for IMG, the automated computer composition system

bssa	stand-alone (non-window) version of IMG
mkcc acca accl inst cntl mpuclean merge:
	IMG support routines, not usually called directly

2) Stuff that operates on time-tagged (mpu) midi data

select		"grep" for midi data. Select channels, etc.
transpose	transpose midi data by pitch
chmap		remap midi channels
invert		pitch inversion of mid data
mecho		add echo to midi data
just		quantize the tempo of a midi piece
unjust		randomize the tempo of a midi piece
da		midi dissassembler

3) Stuff that operates on sparc Mu-law audio data

aecho		add an echo
agc		automatic gain control
avmap		change the volume
gate		zero out quiet passages
mumerge		merge multiple audio streams (mixer)
norm		normalize volume
reverb		add reverberation
squelch		remove quiet passages

4) routines for format conversion

mpu2aud		convert time tagged midi to sparcstation mu-law
mpu2smf		convert time-tagged midi to standard midi file format
mpu2sun		convert time tagged midi to SUN midi driver format
plunk		convert a "plucked string" to sparcstation mu-law
smf2mpu		convert standard midi file format to time tagged midi


NOTES:

*  The stuff in sys, is a midi driver for 4.1 sarcstations.
   With this driver you can use your serial ports to generate
   midi, only the level converter is required.  The mpu2sun
   utility converts peters MPU format to the sun midi driver
   format

* The etc/ and obj/ directories are used by IMG, see the enclosed readme
  files

* The stuff in tunes are sample midi files in MPU format

* IMG stands for Incidental Music Generator.  The package has been known 
  by other names in the past.

* Some things to try:

1) < tunes/<something>.mpu mpu2aud > /dev/audio
   plays a tune on the sparcstation, using "pluck"
2) < tunes/<something>.mpu mpu2sun > /dev/midi
   play the tune to a midi device, out the serial port
3) bssa -l25 grass | mpu2aud > /dev/audio
   Composes 25 seconds of blue-grass, and sends it to the speaker.

* Installation instructions
  - set BASE in the makefile
  - run make FLAG=-O, then make install
  - This software was tested on SUN-OS 4.x using the bundled C compuler
